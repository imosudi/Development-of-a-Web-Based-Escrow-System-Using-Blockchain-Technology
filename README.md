# Development of a Web-Based Escrow System Using Blockchain Technology

## Objective
To simulate a secure, decentralised escrow transaction system using smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure, demonstrating automation of digital trust processes in financial exchanges.

## Simulation Type
Blockchain Simulation / Transactional Workflow Simulation / Smart Contract Execution

## Types of Dataset
1. Transaction records
2. user verification logs
3. wallet signatures
4. contract deployment logs

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. Ethereum testnet (Goerli)
2. Thirdweb
3. Blockchain explorers (Etherscan)
4. Local mock data

## Dataset URLs
1. https://thirdweb.com
2. https://goerli.etherscan.io
3. https://github.com/thirdweb-dev

## Setup Instructions
1. 1. Design and simulate the smart contract for escrow logic using Solidity
2. 2. Deploy contracts using Thirdweb on Ethereum testnet
3. 3. Simulate transactions between buyer, seller, and system
4. 4. Create Next.js frontend to interface with smart contract
5. 5. Simulate wallet login and track escrow state transitions
6. 6. Log activities to PostgreSQL for analytics

## Implementation Guide
1. 1. Simulate escrow contract lifecycle (initiation → confirmation → release)
2. 2. Test and simulate dispute resolution mechanisms
3. 3. Simulate wallet-based login and verification workflows
4. 4. Visualise system response for multi-user blockchain interaction
5. 5. Log and display transaction statistics and outcomes

## Expected Output(s)
1. Real-time state transition visualisation of blockchain escrow contracts; smart contract logs; multi-user interaction dashboard; automated payment flows and confirmations; evaluation metrics on transaction cost and time delay

## Background Studies
### Blockchain Simulation
Emulation of decentralised systems where actions are governed by smart contracts and recorded immutably.

### Escrow Contract Simulation
Modelling conditional fund release dependent on multi-party agreement.

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing agreements on a blockchain network ensuring tamper-proof, automated actions.

### Multisig Wallet Simulation
Demonstrating co-signing mechanisms for authorising fund transfers.

### Transaction Latency Analysis
Measuring delays from contract execution to confirmation on the network.

### Decentralised Architecture
Removing central intermediaries to demonstrate distributed control and consensus.

### UI-Blockchain Integration
Building frontend interfaces (Next.js) that interact with smart contracts for input/output visualisation and simulation control.

### Performance Simulation
Evaluating gas cost, time complexity, and system robustness under simulated workloads.
